## <span id = "user-content-2"> <span id = "t2">How `InterServer` Works</span> </span>
Finding a web hosting provider is one of the first steps required to get a website up and running. Shared web hosting means that many websites are hosted on one web server connected to the internet. For the majority of businesses, shared web hosting is more than enough to cover their needs.

A web hosting provider will allow you to have a custom domain name such as www.yourbusinessname.com for a monthly hosting subscription fee. Another option is to use a subdomain from WordPress (or another platform) for free, but it will mean your URL won’t be as professional, as it will include a word such as “WordPress” in the URL and will likely feature standard advertisements on the website that can’t be removed. A paid subscription to shared web hosting is the most affordable way to set up a professional website for your small business.

If you already have a domain name and want to transfer it to a different provider, such as InterServer, you can easily do this. InterServer charges $7.99 to transfer a domain name.

## <span id = "user-content-3"> <span id = "t3">Is `InterServer` Right for Me?</span> </span>
InterServer could be a good choice for your business if you are looking for shared web hosting/VPS with a month-to-month payment plan. However, if you are the kind of customer who feels more secure knowing you can easily reach customer service by phone to ask questions about your website, you may want to consider a different service.

### InterServer Is Best For:
* Business owners who prioritize cost
* Business owners who want one simple plan without worrying about add-ons or extra unexpected expenses
* Website owners who want to use a free website builder to create and design their website

### InterServer Is Not Recommended For:
* People who rely heavily on live chat support. From our experience, the live agents do not thoroughly answer all questions through the chat.

## <span id = "user-content-4"> <span id = "t4">What Sets `InterServer` Apart?</span> </span>
InterServer offers one plan for all shared web hosting needs. While other companies offer different tiers for different plans, 
InterServer structures its pricing as one-size-fits-all. This can be beneficial if you’re looking for a low-cost plan with most of the features 
($7 per month after the introductory offer，use special [COUPON CODE : COUPON20240129](https://www.interserver.net/r/919860) to get more discount). 
However, if you want more advanced offerings or customer support, you may want to consider a competitor.

## <span id = "user-content-5"> <span id = "t5">`InterServer` Features</span> </span>
InterServer offers a number of features that are important to any web hosting service, including:

### Storage and Bandwidth Limits
InterServer offers unlimited storage and bandwidth for all plans.

### Extras and Inclusions
InterServer offers a free SSL certificate, unlimited storage and business emails and a website builder with the Standard plan.

### Ease of Use
InterServer’s navigation was clear but not as up to date as other web hosting platforms. For a modern design, consider one of InterServer’s competitors.

### User Dashboard/cPanel
The original plan comes with a control panel called DirectAdmin. This tool offers what users need to run a website.

However, if you want a cPanel, which will give you more complete access over your website, you’ll need to purchase cPanel web hosting through InterServer. 
This may be slightly confusing since most web hosting providers do not have a separate plan for a cPanel. The cost for cPanel web hosting is slightly more expensive than the standard web hosting
plan, but only by a few dollars. Here are the prices:

* $2.50 for one month, renews at $8 for one month
* $15 for six months, renews at $48 for six months
* $30 for 12 months, renews at $96 for 12 months
### Security
In addition to offering a free SSL certificate, InterServer also comes with Inter-Insurance for free, which will protect your website from potential compromises and hacking. 
Inter-Insurance includes: restoring websites impacted by any malware, investigating why the problem occurred and fixing the issue so that it does not happen again.

[InterServer](https://www.interserver.net/r/919860) only has one standard plan. This plan comes with unlimited storage and bandwidth, a free SSL certificate and a 99.9% uptime guarantee.

The initial offer is only [ $2.50 per month](https://www.interserver.net/webhosting?id=919860), which is in line with competitor offers. The standard cost of this plan is $7 per month, regardless of whether you sign up for one month or two years. This can be cost-effective if you want to sign up for a monthly plan, but if you prefer to commit to a plan long term, then you will be better off with a competitor that offers steep discounts on multi-year plans.

## <span id = "user-content-7"> <span id = "t7">Customer Service and Support</span> </span>
[InterServer](https://www.interserver.net/r/919860) offers live chat and 24/7 phone support. Though live support is available both to existing customers and prospective ones, we found the chat feature difficult to use. Initially, we were told the estimated wait time would be 34 minutes, and then after we received an initial response, there was a delay before receiving a response to the follow-up question.

The following times we communicated with the live agent we received more prompt responses, but they were not all helpful and many responses did not answer our question specifically.

We tried reaching out to InterServer by phone multiple times on two separate days, and each time were put on hold for six minutes before the call dropped. Overall, customer support was one of the least helpful we’ve experienced from web hosting providers.

## <span id = "user-content-8"> <span id = "t8">Additional Features Worth Noting</span> </span>
[InterServer](https://www.interserver.net/r/919860) also offers reselling hosting services for professionals who are operating and selling multiple websites. The reselling hosting costs $19.95 per month for 20 cPanel accounts and comes with daily backups and unlimited domains, in addition to all the features available in the standard shared web hosting.

[InterServer](https://www.interserver.net/r/919860) offers a separate offer of private email hosting for $2.50 per month. Another benefit to signing up with InterServer is that it promises to maintain a 50% capacity policy as a way to ensure it is able to meet its customers’ needs.

## <span id = "user-content-10"> <span id = "t10">Expert Opinion</span> </span>
[InterServer](https://www.interserver.net/r/919860) is a solid choice for a basic starter web hosting provider. At $2.50 per month for an introductory offer, 
InterServer’s initial offer is one of the more competitive on the market. The company’s monthly rate of $7 per month is competitive for users who want a month-by-month plan but is not recommended for those who want to sign on for a multi-year plan.

The company’s Inter-Insurance helps ensure your website will be protected, particularly the promise to investigate and determine why the issue occurred. Perhaps the biggest downside to signing up with InterServer is the lack of reliable customer support.
